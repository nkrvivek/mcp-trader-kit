# traderkit

Risk-gate MCP server for AI-assisted trading. Enforces position caps, wash-sale rules, and forbidden-structure checks before any order hits your broker.

Built for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) + [SnapTrade](https://snaptrade.com/). Works with any MCP client.

## Install

```bash
npx -y traderkit
```

Or globally:

```bash
npm install -g traderkit
```

### `check_trade`

The primary gate. Validates, in order:

- **R0 freshness (hard)** — every live-data input must carry an `as_of` ISO timestamp within its TTL. Missing/stale = reject. No inline opt-out.
- **Order size cap** — rejects if `notional_usd` exceeds `max_order_notional`
- **Concentration cap** — rejects if post-trade single-name exposure exceeds `max_single_name_pct`; in strict_mode also rejects when `portfolio_total_usd` is missing
- **Forbidden tools** — blocks specific broker tools (e.g., margin tools)
- **Forbidden leg shapes** — blocks option structures (e.g., `naked_put`, `naked_call`)
- **R1 expiry-day window** — blocks new short legs on expiry day during configured window (default 13:30–14:30Z)
- **R2 strike-grid** — requires ≥3 adjacent strikes w/ theta-per-Δ comparison; rejects selection materially worse than best
- **R7 thesis-required** — requires active `thesis_ref` (or declared `discretionary_event` + ≥10-char rationale)
- **Wash-sale check** — flags if same ticker was sold at a loss within ±30 days (same `tax_entity`)

Returns `{ pass: boolean, reasons: string[], warnings: string[], ticket_id?: string }`. Each run also appends to `$TRADERKIT_HOME/gate_audit/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (hash-chained append-only audit).

**Stale data = no trade, ever.** In `strict_mode` (default true), any gate that can't verify its data fails-closed. Disable individual rules only via profile-level toggles (`rules.R0_no_stale_data: false`), not per-request.

### `verify_fill` (R4)

Compare intended vs filled quantities per leg and coerce session status. Required before `session_write` marks status as `executed`.

Input: `legs[{leg_id, intended_qty, filled_qty, status?}]` + `source` tag (`ib-gateway` | `ib-flex` | `snaptrade-list-orders` | `tradestation` | `manual`).

Returns `overall_status` (`executed` | `partial-fill` | `submitted-unverified` | `failed`), `coerced_status_label` for ready-to-write frontmatter, `safe_to_mark_executed: boolean`, and warnings (e.g., `ib-gateway` auto-warn that Friday fills are only visible via Flex on Monday).

### `repricing_check` (R3)

Given an order in flight — `submitted_at`, `limit_price`, `underlying_price_at_submit`, `underlying_price_now` — returns `action` (`HOLD` | `REPRICE` | `CANCEL`) + reasons. Flags `REPRICE` when age ≥ `stale_minutes` (default 30) AND underlying moved ≥ `adverse_move_pct` (default 2%).

### `reconcile_reminder` (R5)

After any IBKR multi-leg session (`order_count ≥ 2`), checks whether IB Flex reconcile is overdue vs `sla_hours` (default 24). Returns the shell command to run with the configured query_id: `cd ~/Development/radon && .venv/bin/python3 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py --json --query-id <qid>`.

### `expiry_priority` (R8)

Given `expiring_legs[]` (w/ strike, underlying_price, option_type, side) and planned `new_cycle_legs[]`, returns an ordered processing list (ITM first → ATM → OTM → new-cycle) and flags violations when ITM/ATM resolution is pending while new-cycle writes are queued.

### `check_wash_sale`

Standalone wash-sale check. Pulls last 30 days of activity from a sibling [snaptrade-trade-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snaptrade-trade-mcp) server. Pools all accounts under the same `tax_entity` (e.g., all personal accounts share one wash-sale window; an LLC has its own).

Graceful degradation: if snaptrade-read is unavailable, returns `flagged: false` with a warning rather than blocking.

### `scan_tlh`

Scans your positions for tax-loss harvesting opportunities. Filters to positions with unrealized loss above a threshold (default $500), then excludes any that would trigger a wash sale. Returns candidates sorted by loss size (largest first).

Requires positions data as input (from `get_positions` or equivalent).

### `check_concentration`

Analyzes portfolio concentration against profile caps. Returns every position labeled:

- **HEADROOM** — well below cap
- **AT-CAP** — 75-90% of cap
- **NEAR-CAP** — 90-100% of cap
- **OVER-CAP** — exceeds cap

Also returns the [HHI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index) (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) as a single-number diversification score, and the top 5 positions.

### `regime_gate`

Checks if a trade should proceed under the current market regime:

| Tier | Size multiplier | Max DTE | Blocked actions |
|------|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| CLEAR | 1.0x | unlimited | none |
| CAUTION | 0.75x | 45 DTE | none |
| DEFENSIVE | 0.5x | 30 DTE | BUY, BUY_TO_OPEN |
| HALT | 0.25x | 14 DTE | BUY, BUY_TO_OPEN, SELL_TO_OPEN |

Returns adjusted notional, preferred structures for the tier, and whether the proposed structure aligns.

### `propose_trade`

End-to-end trade proposal builder. Takes a ticker, price, portfolio context, and regime tier. Produces a fully sized proposal with:

- **Headroom-based sizing** — `(cap% - current%) × 0.5 × NAV × regime_multiplier`
- **Cap enforcement** — capped at profile's `max_order_notional`
- **Regime blocking** — rejects BUY in DEFENSIVE/HALT
- **Concentration check** — rejects adds when already OVER-CAP
- **Sizing trace** — human-readable formula for audit

Optional: attach `thesis_ref` and `signal_summary` for proposal context.

### `track_tax`

Computes running tax exposure from an array of realized trades:

- Separates STCG (<365 days) from LTCG (≥365 days)
- Computes reserves at configurable rates (defaults: STCG 35.8%, LTCG 18.8%)
- Tracks gains and losses separately per bucket
- Flags wash-sale-adjusted trades
- Returns per-trade breakdown sorted by date

### `trigger_check`

Event detector for portfolio monitoring. Checks three conditions:

- **NAV_MOVE** — triggers on ±2% NAV change (configurable). CRITICAL at ±4%.
- **REGIME_SHIFT** — fires when regime tier changes. CRITICAL on deterioration, INFO on improvement.
- **CONCENTRATION_BREACH** — flags positions exceeding the cap. CRITICAL when 10pp+ over.

Returns events sorted by severity (CRITICAL → WARNING → INFO).

### `performance_metrics`

Computes portfolio performance metrics from a daily returns series:

- **Sharpe ratio** — risk-adjusted return (sample variance, annualized)
- **Sortino ratio** — downside-only volatility version
- **Max drawdown** — largest peak-to-trough decline (fraction 0–1), with peak/trough indices
- **Calmar ratio** — annualized return / max drawdown
- **Win rate** — fraction of positive returns, plus average win and average loss

Requires minimum 20 observations by default (configurable via `min_observations`). Supports custom `risk_free_rate` (default 5%) and `periods_per_year` (default 252).

### `thesis_fit`

Scores how well a trade aligns with active theses:

- **IN_THESIS** — ticker + structure match an active thesis
- **PARTIAL** — ticker matches but structure doesn't
- **OFF_THESIS** — ticker not in thesis, or thesis is closed
- **NO_THESIS_REF** — no `thesis_ref` provided

Supports `score_fit` (single) and `batch_score` (portfolio-wide). Batch returns a summary with counts per score tier.

### `trading_calendar`

NYSE trading calendar with 10 observed holidays + Good Friday. Five actions:

- `is_trading_day` — check if a date is a trading day
- `next_trading_day` / `prev_trading_day` — find adjacent trading days
- `last_trading_day_of_month` — useful for monthly rolls and reviews
- `trading_days_between` — count trading days in a range

### `session_write`

Formats session document sections as markdown. Four actions:

- `format_executed` — markdown table of executed trades
- `format_deferred` — bullet list with deferred tags
- `format_no_trade` — bullet list of rejected tickers with reasons
- `format_session_index_row` — 11-column index table row for session tracking

### `broker_route`

Classifies broker routing for order dispatch:

- **SNAPTRADE** — Fidelity, E-Trade, Robinhood, Schwab, IBKR
- **TRADESTATION** — TradeStation
- **MANUAL** — Ally, Morgan Stanley, unknown brokers
- **DEFERRED** — any trade with deferred tags (overrides broker classification)

## Setup

### 1. Create profiles

Profiles live in `~/.traderkit/profiles/` as markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: personal
broker: snaptrade
account_id: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
tax_entity: personal
caps:
  max_order_notional: 10000
  max_single_name_pct: 25
  forbidden_tools: []
  forbidden_leg_shapes: [naked_put, naked_call]
---
```

Get your `account_id` from `list_accounts`.

### 2. Register in Claude Code

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "traderkit": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "traderkit"] }
  }
}
```

### 3. Wire the PreToolUse hook

The companion [PreToolUse hook](https://github.com/nkrvivek/traderkit/blob/main/scripts/pre-tool-use.js) calls `check_trade` automatically before any destructive broker tool fires. Add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__snaptrade-trade__equity_force_place|mcp__snaptrade-trade__mleg_place",
        "command": "node ~/.traderkit/scripts/pre-tool-use.js"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
traderkit  # starts MCP server on stdio
```

In Claude Code: ask "list profiles" to confirm the server is connected.

## How it works

```

                                    │
                                    ├─ caps check (profile YAML)

- **Fail-closed by default.** If traderkit can't evaluate a trade, it blocks.
- **Credential redaction.** All tool responses are scrubbed — any env secret substring (8+ chars) is replaced with `<REDACTED>`.
- **Tax-entity pooling.** Wash-sale checks span all accounts with the same `tax_entity`. Personal brokerage + IRA = one pool. LLC = separate pool.
